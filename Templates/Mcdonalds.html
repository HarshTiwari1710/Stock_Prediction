            <h1 class="h-primary">MCDONALD'S - A Richard World</h1>
            <p>McDonald's Corporation is an American fast food
                company, founded in 1940 as a restaurant operated
                by Richard and Maurice McDonald, in San Bernardino,
                California, United States. They rechristened their
                business as a hamburger stand, and later turned
                the company into a franchise, with the Golden
                Arches logo being introduced in 1953 at a
                location in Phoenix, Arizona. In 1955, Ray Kroc,
                a businessman, joined the company as a
                franchise agent and proceeded to purchase the
                chain from the McDonald brothers. McDonald's
                had its original headquarters in Oak Brook,
                Illinois, but moved its global headquarters to
                Chicago in June 2018.

                McDonald's is the world's largest restaurant chain by revenue,serving over 69 million customers daily in
                over 100 countries[11] across 37,855 outlets as of 2018. Although McDonald's is best known for its
                hamburgers, cheeseburgers and french fries, they feature chicken products, breakfast items, soft drinks,
                milkshakes, wraps, and desserts. In response to changing consumer tastes and a negative backlash because
                of the unhealthiness of their food,[14] the company has added to its menu salads, fish, smoothies, and
                fruit.</p>
